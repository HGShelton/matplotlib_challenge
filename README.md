UNC class challenge 5 assignment

Help with code:
-duplicate mice by ID number - help from Justin, tutor, with bracket placement for duplicate code
-clean DataFrame - help from Justin, tutor, with identifying the type of function needed to run thed code
-aggregate method - used Xpert Learning Assistant to define and show code for the aggregate method
-plot bar graph of rows (Drug Regimen/Timepoint) using Pandas - used Xpert Learning Assistant to identify the code needed to sort Drug Regimen data in descending order and bars closer together
-Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using Pandas - used Xpert Learning Assistant to identify how to flip male and female data on pie chart.
-Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using pyplot - Used Xpert Learning Assistant to remove coordinates that printed in the top left corner of the chart and to learn how to place a label to the left 
of the chart
-Calculate the IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers - Worked with peer (Zach) to identify code and fix errors for boxplot subset and generating boxplot
-Generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin - Used Xpert Learning Assistant to write capomulin_data code and how to extract 'Timepoint' and 'Tumor Volume (mm3)' data points to create the line graph
